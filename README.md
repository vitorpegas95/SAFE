S.A.F.E is a free and secure Encryption/Decryption software built with VB.NET.

Your encrypted text can only be decrypted using the S.A.F.E Key. 

How it works: 
1- You enter the text to be encrypted in the textbox

2- You enter your secret S.A.F.E Key (please remember it!)

3- You press the Encrypt Button

4- Now your encrypt text is stored in the APP (encrypted)

5- You can export it (and you should for security reasons) using the File>Export button in the menu bar

6- To decrypt your text you can either copy from the txt file created after export on the same location as the APP or just press Load to load the APP's stored encrypted text.


If you are distributing this APP, please delete the APP encrypted text for security reasons by using the File>Clean APP in the menu bar
